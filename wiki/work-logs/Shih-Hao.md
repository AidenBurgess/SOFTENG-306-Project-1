-   Made ProbabilisticParallelDFS
-   Compared performance

## 26/08/20

-   Implemented processor symmetry
-   Implemented repeated states
-   Refactored and created DFSListeners

## 24/08/20

-   Refined Optimality test to use JUnit Params to automate checking

## 23/08/20

-   Implemented versions of Parallel DFSBB

## 20/08/20

-   Added middleman InformationHolder class
