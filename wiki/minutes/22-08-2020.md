## Main Points/Decisions

- Made sure everyone had the project working in Java 8
- Main issues with going from 11 to 8 are related to JFX and JFoenix
- Aiden added new JavaFX and JFoenix jars that should be compatible with Java 8
- We should all check all the deliverables.
- Talk about what we can change as a team to make sure things go smoothly for next milestone
  - Generally: less individualistic work and make sure more people are involved in all parts of work.
  - More focus on reviewing and testing.
  - Check the correctness and robustness of each new build
  - Be critical of each other and hold each other more accountable.
  - 2 people review pull requests
  - Even though 1 or 2 people will submit the deliverable everyone should run the implementation on their machine before submission.
- Report: Charles will start making report skeleton today and then in our next meeting we will start looking into building it up further.
- Make sure for week 6 we plan well to avoid clashing with assessments/assignments from other courses
  - Compsci 367 test on the 1st of September
  - Softeng 370 test on the 3rd of September
  - Best to complete most of report work before that week.
