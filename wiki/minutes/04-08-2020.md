# Meeting Minutes 04/08/2020

Present: Seif, Anubhav, Seif, Aiden, Samuel, Charles

Absent: No one

Meeting time: 8am - 10am

## Agenda

- Problem Definition
- Solution Brainstorm
- Github repo set-up
- How do we plan to use it?
- Go over the Gantt chart from last meeting at the end

## Due Dates

- Project Plan Wednesday 5th August 11am
- Milestone 1 Monday 17th August 10am

## Actions or Tasks

### Completed

- Project Plan (submitted)
- Problem definition

### In-progress

-

### Incomplete

- Algorithm pseudocode
- Class diagram
- UI prototypes/wireframes

## Main Points/Decisions

- Visualisation is a flag that can be added in the command.
- Research on how to use threading (threading pools are an option)
- Sam's findings: Two algorithms (DFS branch & bound, IDA\*) perform differently
- DFS branch and bound:
  - can tell user when the solution is found
  - good for visualisation
- IDA\*
  - lets us see the layers that we are searching
  - searching for a solution less than k
  - at the time, they know what the best solution isnâ€™t
- Decided that it is best to go with DFS.
- JavaFX will be used for the visualisation UI.
- For visualisation, we can:
  - visualise the schedule
  - display statistics
  - visualise the dependency tree
- Sree, Seif & Aiden (algorithm team)will work on psuedocode and class diagrams
- Charles, Anubhav & Samuel (UI team) will work on low-fidelity UI prototype and possibly also a high-fidelity prototype
- "Teams" are not final, we are just splitting work up for the planning stage.
- **Next meeting: Thursday 6th August, 12pm.**
