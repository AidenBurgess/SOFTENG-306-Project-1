# Meeting Minutes 17/08/2020

Present: Anubhav, Sree, Aiden, Sam, Seif, Charles

Absent: No one

Meeting time: 1pm-2pm

## Agenda

- Look at what tasks we should complete and assign before/after milestone 1 submission.

## Due Dates

- Milestone 1 Wednesday 19th August 10am

## Actions or tasks

### Complete

- Set up scenebuilder/jfoenix for visualisation
- Cleanup code and comments
- Performance tests for scheduler

### In-progress

- Moving docs from Google Docs to wiki
- Generate jar for milestone 1

### Incomplete

- Algorithm Optimisation
- Visualisation implementation
- Add statistics to scheduler (for visualisation)

## Main Points/Decisions

- Recap of what will be included in visualisation
  - Charts - of the state
  - Line graphs for CPU, Memory
  - Settings pop up (adjusting refresh rate, dark mode)
  - Styling - CSS (if we have time)
- Talked about ways to implement parallelisation: ThreadPools
- Further optimisations to algorithms: FFunction, Different data structures (e.g. stack for list of tasks in processor)
- Could make a Scheduler class for only 1 processor, would just find topological order and schedule tasks in that order on the processor
- Might want to make test cases more specific (eg dense), and target some more edge cases.
- Aiden, Seif and Sam will work on algorithm optimisation.
- Charles, Anubhav and Sree will work on visualisation implementation.
- 2 teams can meet up individually before next "full" meeting.
- Next meeting: Friday 21th August, 13:00 - 15:00.
