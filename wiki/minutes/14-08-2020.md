### Meeting Minutes 14/08/2020

Present: Anubhav, Sree, Aiden, Sam, Seif, Charles

Absent: No one

Meeting time: 1pm-2pm

## Agenda

- Go over the algorithm teams skeleton code

## Due Dates

- Milestone 1 Wednesday 19th August 10am

## Actions or tasks

### Complete

- Initial algorithm implementation
- Dot parser and writer
- Command parser

### In-progress

-

### Incomplete

- Move docs to wiki
- Generate .jar and release for milestone 1
- Set-up for scenebuilder and Jfoenix for visualisaiton
- Implement multithreading
- Algorithm optimisations
  - New Ffunction (using different heuristics)
  - Different data structure for storing nodes which are not scheduled
  - Finding a way to deep copy properly for storing the best state
  - Optimising search process when there are multiple empty processors (If all the processors are empty, we don’t want to try put it on every processor as all the empty processors are the ‘same’).
  - Different syntax in for loops?

## Main Points/Decisions

- Algorithm team went over their implementation
- Team discussed possible optimisations that could be made
- Seif will work on starting up the wiki
- Seif and Anubhav will create the .jar artifact for milestone 1.
- Discussed possibility of just turning off visualisation for the release
- Aiden will setup scenebuilder and jfoenix for visualisation
- Look at for loops (method calls in condition section) https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3881660/java-for-loop-evaluation#:~:text=6-,Yes.,of%20the%20loop%20at%20all.&text=Yes%2C%20the%20expression%20must%20be,loop%20or%20continue%20program%20execution.
- Charles and Anubhav will clean up the code and rewrite some comments.
- Sam will work on writing more tests for scheduler
- Multithreading should be done fairly easily
- Sam and Charles will work on performance testing for the scheduler: timing + multiple tests
- We will need to add statistics info to Scheduler
- Low prio: Multiple scheduler classes for different situations (i.e. UI vs no UI, 1 processor vs multiple processors)
