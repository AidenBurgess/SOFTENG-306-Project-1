# Visualisation Module

JavaFX was used to create the visualisation module. It has five components as shown in the picture below. They are current/best schedules, CPU/RAM graphs, and algorithm statistics.

## Interactivity

The tasks on the current and the best schedules can be hovered over and a tooltip with the name, length, start time and the end time of the task.

## Styling
