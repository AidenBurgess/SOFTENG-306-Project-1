# SOFTENG 306 Project 1

This is the repository for Team 5 - Anubhav's Cheerleaders. This includes the project code, the wiki and the executable file for the project, "scheduler.jar"

## Instructions

The file "scheduler.jar" contains the full project, including all dependencies. It can be executed independently from the command line:
`java -jar scheduler.jar INPUT.dot P [OPTION]`
| Argument (optional args in _italics_) | Meaning |
| -------- | ----- |
| INPUT.dot | File path to a task graph with integer weights in .dot format |
| P | The number of processors to schedule the input graph on |
| _-o OUTPUT_ | Path to write output to |

If you want to compile the code, the .jar files in `/project1/resources` will have to be added as libraries for the project.

## Wiki

The wiki can be found in `/wiki`. The markdown file for the home page is found [here](wiki/README.md)
